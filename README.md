# Phising_url_detector
A Flask-based web application that detects phishing URLs using machine learning. It extracts 15+ technical and content-based features from the given URL and applies a trained model to classify it as phishing or legitimate. Includes PCA and domain analysis for accuracy

## ðŸš€ Features

- Extracts 15+ handcrafted features from URLs
- Domain age & expiration-based analysis using WHOIS
- Checks for shortened URLs, suspicious words, unicode, and more
- HTML/JS content behavior analysis (iframe, mouseover, forwarding)
- Uses PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Trained ML model using PyCaret
- Simple UI for user input via browser

---

## ðŸ§  How it Works

1. **Feature Extraction:**  
   Extracts URL length, depth, presence of symbols, keywords, domain data, and content behavior.

2. **Model Prediction:**  
   A trained PyCaret model classifies the input as `Phishing` or `Legitimate`.

3. **Frontend:**  
   Basic HTML form that accepts a URL and displays the result with a probability score.
